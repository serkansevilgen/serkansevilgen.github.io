**GendyCloud (in progress)**
2022 *Networked music, multichannel, web interface, Csound*  

This work is heavily inspired by an event during Xenakis Centenary Symposium. In front of the building where Xenakis was wounded, participants played a stream of sounds generated by Gendy with their phones. (https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd9M4beoade/) The idea is to generate a cloud of Gendy sounds around the audience with multi-channel setup. The performer are assigned for each instrument. They control the duration of the state with a very simple web-based user interface.  The communication between the web interface and Csound will be handled via Remote OSC (a Node.js library written by Serkan Sevilgen to enable hassle-free data and code sharing between computer musicians. https://github.com/serkansevilgen/remote-osc).  

A demo with web interface for stereo setup can be seen here:

**Mar8**  
2022 *Field recordings, multichannel, Csound*  

The sound materials for the piece are the recordings of the police helicopters that I made from my home window during the Women’s March at Istiklal Street on March 8th, 2021. I extracted 15 audio files after an hour of recording that you hear a helicopter comes into the soundscape and goes.  The sound doesn’t move circularly in 8-channel diffusion but goes across the listening hall from many directions to eventually build up a thick and almost suffocating soundscape above the audience.

**Coding Coppers**  
2021 *Live electronics, live Coding, Python, SuperCollider, Arduino*  

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FMzYgew6co](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FMzYgew6co)

Live coding is usually associated with computer-based sound generation. In this piece I try to explore the area of live coding for acoustic objects. Live coding with Python language acts as an interface to control the servo motors which are attached to an Arduino board. A microphone picks the sound and a Supercollider-based live coding interface manipulates the sounds gently. The piece is inspired by the work of Andre Valle. However the output is aimed at generating more limited sets of sounds and not excessive manipulation respecting the silent moments.

**The Curtain and Beyond with Fulya Ucanok**  
2020 *live electronics, Csound*  

In this performance, the duo delves into the discourses around the Pythagorean curtain that has been an inspiration for the acousmatic tradition. Taking it literally, the performance integrates an actual curtain in physical space performance conditions, However, they use other virtual tools to create the curtain for network performances. The curtain aims to weave together historical and current discourses around acousmatic music practice. Integrating the acousmatic into a live performance setting, they create dialogues between parallel worlds of source-bonded/source-ambiguous sound events, various forms of presences/absences, the real/unreal, and linearity/non-linearity in the narrative.

**Transfigured Walls**  
2020 *Fixed media, binaural, Csound*  

[https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/transfigured-walls-a-binaural-acousmatic-piece-use-earphones](https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/transfigured-walls-a-binaural-acousmatic-piece-use-earphones)

During the COVID-19 pandemic composers and musicians persevere with producing new works. However, since the only distribution channel is online we lost the ability to create multichannel music that we can design a spatial experience in physical venues. In this fixed media piece, I deliberately target the audience that consumes music with earphones. I used Csound’s HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function) opcodes to create a virtual binaural space that I can specify the dimensions of the room, reflection coefficients of the walls, floor, and ceiling. The listener would enjoy the 3D soundstage with moving sounds in all dimensions.  

It was presented during the Share the Sound Concert (2020) and Tehran International Electronic Music Festival (2022)

**Image sonification in memoriam Ertuğrul Oğuz Fırat**  
2020 *Fixed media, Python, Csound*

[https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/image-sonification-in-memoriam-ertugrul-oguz-firat](https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/image-sonification-in-memoriam-ertugrul-oguz-firat)

This piece was composed in memory of the Turkish composer, painter, and poet Ertuğrul Oğuz Fırat (1923-2014). One of the composer’s paintings, Politika, is used as a material for the image sonification. The RGB (red, green, blue) channel data of each pixel in Politika was read with Python programming language. In Csound, image data is mapped to several parameters to reveal the patterns in the painting in the rhythmic texture.
 
It was presented during the homage concert on 10 February 2020 at ITU/MIAM Library and SIIDS - Sound, Image and Interaction Design Symposium (2020)  

**Wanderer**  
2019 *Fixed media, multichannel, Csound*

[https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/octophonic-site-specific-piece-for-the-miam-gallery](https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/octophonic-site-specific-piece-for-the-miam-gallery) (Stereo render)

This piece is composed for an 8-channel diffusion system in which speakers are spread through MIAM Gallery. Works for the concert are site-specific, composed for a bespoke multichannel diffusion system, making the event fall somewhere between an installation and a concert. Attendees are encouraged to move around to tailor their audio-spatial experience. The piece is consists of distinct sections that I explore different sonic textures. The sections are self-contained and don't present a particular progression. The musical material is laid out and sufficient time is given to the listener to consume the possibilities in limited musical material. The piece was composed solely in Csound.
 
It was presented during the “Sonic Tales from the Crypt” concert on 26 December 2019 at ITU/MIAM Gallery and in the Festival of Sound Art and Transmedia Ecos Urbanos (Mexico and CCRMA/Stanford)

**Spectral Collage**  
2019 *Installation, MaxMSP
*4 layers of audio, excerpts from field recordings at Istanbul, single cutoff frequency, 23 min. (fast-forwarded)*  

[https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/spectral-collage-render-1](https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/spectral-collage-render-1)

Proof-of-concept render of a sound installation work that is supposed to be run for the duration of an exhibition. Layers of sounds from field recordings of a city/site are torn down gradually with a very steep-sloped, brick wall type filter. After a while what we hear is slow but everchanging frequencies which any audio layers can hardly be distinguishable. 

**Strng Wnd**  
*Soundscape, 2019*  

[https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/strng-wnd](https://soundcloud.com/serkansevilgen/strng-wnd)

I try to detect and record soundscapes that resemble my ideas of sound design and composition. Awareness of sonic environment and making decisions, what and how to record makes recording more like a compositional process. In this track I have removed the wind shield from Sennheiser MKH 416 shotgun microphone and exposed it to a very strong wind.

**Published soundscapes**  
Two soundscape pieces published in the 2013 World Listening Day compilation by Sonic Field.
