## Transfigured Walls
*Binaural, fixed media, 2020*  

During the COVID-19 pandemic composers and musicians persevere with producing new works. However, since the only distribution channel is online we lost the ability to create multichannel music that we can design a spatial experience in physical venues. In this fixed media piece, I deliberately target the audience that consumes music with earphones. I used Csound’s HRTF (Head Related Transfer Function) opcodes to create a virtual binaural space that I can specify the dimensions of the room, reflection coefficients of the walls, floor, and ceiling. The listener would enjoy the 3D soundstage with moving sounds in all dimensions.  

It was presented during the Share the Sound Concert which was streamed live on Facebook.

## Image sonification in memoriam Ertuğrul Oğuz Fırat
*Fixed media, 2020*

This piece was composed in memory of the Turkish composer, painter, and poet Ertuğrul Oğuz Fırat (1923-2014). One of the composer’s paintings, Politika, is used as a material for the image sonification. The RGB (red, green, blue) channel data of each pixel in Politika was read with Python programming language. In Csound, image data is mapped to several parameters to reveal the patterns in the painting in the rhythmic texture.
 
It was presented during the homage concert on 10 February 2020  at ITU/MIAM Library.

## The octophonic site-specific piece for the MIAM Gallery 
*multichannel, fixed media, 2019*

This piece is composed for an 8-channel diffusion system in which speakers are spread through MIAM Gallery. Works for the concert are site-specific, composed for a bespoke multichannel diffusion system, making the event fall somewhere between an installation and a concert. Attendees are encouraged to move around to tailor their audio-spatial experience. The piece is consists of distinct sections that I explore different sonic textures. The sections are self-contained and don't present a particular progression. The musical material is laid out and sufficient time is given to the listener to consume the possibilities in limited musical material. The piece was composed solely in Csound.
 
It was presented during the “Sonic Tales from the Crypt” concert on 26 December 2019 at ITU/MIAM Gallery.

## A tele-acousmatic improvisation with Fulya Ucanok
*improvisation, acousmatic, 2020*  

Fulya Uçanok and Serkan Sevilgen are a duo who is fascinated by microscopic details of sound objects and exploring their intimate and fragile sound worlds through low-level listening.

They find their roots and inspirations in early electroacoustic music, musique concrète tradition, soundscape, deep listening experiences, chance operations, free improvisation, and minimalism. Their music emphasizes the temporal nature of music, impermanence, fragility, as well as the ambiguity of silence through attentive listening to minute details.
